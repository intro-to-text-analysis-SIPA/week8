# Week 8: Data collection: Working with APIs

<br>


<div align="center">**This session will take place on Zoom**</div>

<br>

This week, we will learn how to make data requests from an Application Programming Interface (API). APIs allow users to programmatically extract and interact with data under the hood of websites, social networks, applications, and projects. For example, the weather app on your phone connects to the weather bureau's API system, which contains daily weather data, and shows you daily weather updates. We will specifically work with the free version of News API for collecting news data. 

- Topics covered:
    - What is an Application Programming Interface (API)?
    - How is it different from web scraping?
    - How to find APIs?
- Curriculum for this session:
    - Rebecca Krisel's [Intro to APIs with Python](https://gist.github.com/rskrisel/4ff9629df9f9d6bf5a638b8ba6c13a68)
- Assignments (due by 10am on the day of class):
   - Work through the curriculum for the upcoming week's session in a Jupyter Notebook. Download your Jupyter Notebook as "ipynb" file (Go to "File", "Download as", "Notebook (.ipynb)"), and [upload](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) the file to the weekly GitHub assignment link.
        -  You are welcome to use the dataset provided in the curriculum link or use a dataset of your choice. 
- Final project deliverable:
    - Project proposals due
